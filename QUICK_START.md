   - "Show agent performance" ✅
   - "agent scores" ✅
   - "who's doing best" ✅ (defaults to performance)

2. **Ask Follow-ups** - Charts work in conversations
   - First: "Show agent performance"
   - Then: "What about sentiment?"
   - Then: "Any patterns in call duration?"

3. **Get Analysis** - Each chart includes text summary
   - Chart + insights together
   - No need to guess what you're seeing

4. **Keep Chatting** - Charts don't interrupt flow
   - Request chart
   - Ask questions about it
   - Request another chart
   - All in one conversation
